# Usage
```python3.6 -m fsq2gmaps```

import CSV on google maps (4sq)

# Requirements
```pip3 install foursquare webcolors```

# Adding maps
* Run script
* Open the map, delete all existing layers (TODO opportunity to use some automation)
* add new layer
* in file chooser, Ctrl-L and paste the link

# TODO
* ugh apparently there is no way to add places via google maps api :( https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35820262
** use js automation for adding the list?
* sync with my personal places list? 
* show checkins? actually, this could be even more useful!
* maybe, filter by checkin count.. and show the count in description, or as a label with number (or maybe part of place name)
* or, maybe figure out 'implicit' visits from google maps and add them on map too?
